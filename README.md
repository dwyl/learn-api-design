# Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Having a *great* API will make or break your project/product. <br />
We expect a **_significant_ percentage**
of the **`people`** using our `App` 
to access the `API` 
either for automation -
e.g: via a Voice Assistant -
or simply to extract, analyze & visualize their data in interesting ways.
in many ways, we think 
[_the **`API` is** the **Product**_!](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/273)

With that in mind, 
we want to research and learn
how to build the best `API` we possibly can
and document as much as possible
so others can learn from our quest!

# What? üí≠

The term **`API`**
stands for 
"**Application Programming Interface**" 
~ 
[wikipedia.org/wiki/API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
An `API` is a **way of communicating with a system _programmatically_**.
It is a structured way for one program to offer services to other programs.

## Types of `API` (Quick History Lesson)

An `API` comes in different forms.
When a developer get down to building an `API`,
they first decide which specification to use.
Most of the time, they go for `REST`.
But, analyzing product requirements, 
a tech team may come to the conclusion 
that calls for a different approach.

`RESTful` `APIs` weren't always the *de facto* way of building `APIs`.
In fact, there is an historical precedence to it.

### RPC

The earliest and simplest form of an `API`
was **`RPC` Remote Procedure Call**,
hailing from the 80's.

The name speaks for itself.
It's a straightforward interaction where a local client
sends commands to a remote server.

Here's a closer look at how it works.
Both client and server use different call parameters,
so they must be converted so it is understood by the other side.
This conversion is made inside **stubs**.

<img width="1418" alt="workflow RPC" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209990909-d2996bea-3162-4915-941d-944773505be4.png">

`RPC` started with `XML` and later `JSON`-based versions.
However, in 2015, Google created 
[`gRPC`](https://grpc.io/),
a general-purpose `RPC` framework.
Systems like 
[`Apache Thrift`](https://thrift.apache.org/)
or Twitch's 
[`Twirp`](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2018/01/16/twirp-a-sweet-new-rpc-framework-for-go-5f2febbf35f/)
use `gRPC` for internal communication between (micro)services.


### `SOAP`

In 1999, engineers at
Microsoft created [`SOAP`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP#History) - 
**Simple Object Access Protocol**.

Initially, `XML` `RPC` had a problem - 
it didn't distinguish between data types.
So devs had to add additional metadata 
to label a field with a data type.
Aiming for consistency, 
`SOAP` carved the format of the transmitted message *in stone*.
It was informative but *rather verbose*.

<img width="1413" alt="soap" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/209992355-6bb307a5-52fb-47c7-8718-edd6811c3621.png">

A `SOAP` message **is framed with an envelope tag** 
(root element that starts and ends the message),
**a header** and **a body**.

Although `SOAP` is not as popular as `REST`,
it's still around, especially in financial services.
This is because it uses
([`WS-Security`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Security)).
`SOAP WS-Security extension` to encrypt messages
and only the recipient with a security token can read it.

### `REST`

**Representational State Transfer** (**REST**) is a software architecture
style consisting of guidelines and best practices for creating
scalable web services.
This is an architectural pattern
that describes how systems
can expose a consistent interface.
When people use the term `REST API`, 
they are referring to an API accessed via `HTTP` protocol
at a predefined set of URLs.

Whilst `SOAP` allows for _stateful_ interactions -
where the server is aware of _previous_ requests -
`RESTful` APIs are **_stateless_**, 
thus treating every request as distinct.

`RESTful` APIs are **resource-based**, 
meaning the user is manipulating 
(creating, updating, deleting or fetching) resources.

When using a `RESTful API`,
we are specifying the **URI - Uniform Resource Identifier**
and performing **an action** - 
e.g: `GET` `HTTP`(fetching) request.
The response is a `JSON` object
that can be interpreted in _any_ programming language.


#### What is a `RESTful` web service?

![restful API](https://i.imgur.com/xKXnKGT.jpg)

[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
is a structured way of building web services and applications.
When something is described as "RESTful" it simply means it follows a
predefined predictable pattern for how it responds to requests.

For a system to be considered 100% `RESTful`, 
it **ought to** follow six constraints:
- [Uniform Interface](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25172600/rest-what-exactly-is-meant-by-uniform-interface)
    - Identification of resources
    - Manipulation of resources through representations
    - Self-descriptive messages
    - Hypermedia as the engine of the application state.
- [Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol)
- [Client-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)
- [Cacheable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache)
- [Layered System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_system)
- [Code-on-demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting)

While the **uniform interface** constraint is fundamental
to the design of any `RESTful` system,
**code-on-demand** is optional.
Although not mandatory to implement all of the aforementioned,
doing so will result in better,
more usable services.

We recommend the following videos
for an "easy-to-digest" introduction
to these concepts an `REST` as a whole.

For `web RESTful services`-specific resources,
we encourage you to skim through the following resources.

- Beginners Guide: http://www.restapitutorial.com/
- What are RESTful web services: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3636470/1148249
- What is "CRUD"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete

#### Using HTTP Methods for `RESTful` Services

[HTTP verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
represent one of the pillars of the
**uniform interface** constraint we have mentioned earlier.
Resources are manipulated (CRUD) 
and each operation is invoked by these verbs.

+ **GET** = **read** an existing **record** or collection (list of records)
+ **POST** = **create** and ***partial*** update.
+ **PUT** = **create** and [***idempotent***](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1077489/1148249) update
(always send **all** the fields required - not partial update)
+ **PATCH** = partial update (send only the fields to update)
+ **DELETE** = does exactly what it says

> The word "**idempotence**" may be funky
but it represents a rather simple concept.
For a `RESTful` service standpoint,
for an operation to be *idempotent*,
clients can make the same call repeatedly 
while producing the same result.
> The `GET` or `PUT` operation on a `users/12345` URI,
for example, are great examples of this.
Each time they are called, the same result is yielded.

Each operation concerns to a *resource*,
which in turn is identified/located 
through an *URI*.
Here's how these operations are applied to resources:s

+ **GET** /comment - Returns a list of all comments
+ **GET** /comment/:id - Returns a comment with the given id
+ **POST** /comment - Creates a new comment
+ **PUT** /comment/:id - Updates a comment with the given id
+ **PATCH** /comment/:id - Partially update a comment with the given id
+ **DELETE** /comment/:id - Deletes a comment with the given id

This is an overview of how these are implemented.

### Examples of Successful (Good) `RESTful` APIs

You can find endless public APIs across the world-wide-web.
Some of them don't have documentation,
others have decent
and there are others with exceptional 
and comprehensive guides.

Here is a list of examples of public `RESTful` APIs
that have *awesome* documentation.

+ Parse REST API: 
[docs.parseplatform.org/rest/guide](http://docs.parseplatform.org/rest/guide/)
(really good example of good interactive documentation)

+ Stripe:
[stripe.com/docs/api](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
+ Twilio:
[twilio.com/docs/usage/api](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api)

#### `Twitter`

The 
[`Twitter API`](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/platform-overview).
allows developers to query tweets by person, topic, tag or trends.
We could use it to write a bot that displays the top tweets of the day.
As users of the `API`, 
we don't need to know about the _internal_ details
of Twitter's systems, 
nor does Twitter want us to.
But using their `API`, 
we are able to do specific/pre-defined things
(like making a post or reading a timeline).
**Twitter is exposing features to us
through an interface that we can consume**.


## Realtime APIs: `WebSockets`

A [**WebSocket**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
is a realtime protocol that enables **_bidirectional_ communication**
between a web client and a web server
over a single-socket connection.
Excellent Deep Dive:
https://ably.com/topic/websockets

Similarly to `HTTP`, `WebSocket` works on top of the TCP, 
in the *application layer*. 
However, unlike `HTTP`, *they are stateful*,
which makes them highly suitable for 
event-driven services that require **high-frequency communication**. 

> If you don't know what a `socket` is,
or if `TCP` is foreign to you,
we recommend you getting familiar 
with [`TCP/IP``, also known as **Internet Protocol Suite**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite).
>
>![tcp/ip](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/6a0cd3a5b7e709c2f637c959ba98705ad21e4e3c.svg)

To create an `WebSocket` connection,
an initial HTTP *handshake* is made,
and then establishes a persistent connection
where both parties exchange data.
Therefore, a `WebSocket` uses *a single TCP connection for data exchange*,
while `RESTful` APIs require a *new TCP connection* 
on every request/response.

![websockets](https://images.ctfassets.net/ee3ypdtck0rk/0mExYcxsnzccWxnktAKjc/d6bacce5d564f04c7128a3b6cd52e877/websockets.png?w=745&h=724&q=50&fm=webp)

#### Examples of Realtime APIs

One of the biggest uses of realtime APIs
is in the finance world - 
specifically stock/options/crypto trading.

[`Polygon.io`](https://polygon.io/)
is one of the most widely used APIs 
for stock market data visualization.

They offer a `RESTful` API 
but also [provide a **`WebSocket API`**](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/ws_getting-started),
where the user connects to a 
*WebSocket URI* (e.g. `wss://socket.polygon.io/stocks`)
and receives data as the stock prices change in near real-time.

The response object of this API doesn't differ from the "regular ones".
The previous endpoint returns a response object
with a `JSON` format:

```json
{
  "ev": "AM",
  "sym": "GME",
  "v": 4110,
  "av": 9470157,
  "op": 0.4372,
  "vw": 0.4488,
  "o": 0.4488,
  "c": 0.4486,
  "h": 0.4489,
  "l": 0.4486,
  "a": 0.4352,
  "z": 685,
  "s": 1610144640000,
  "e": 1610144700000
}
```

The `s` and `e` fields pertain to the timestamp of the starting and ending tick
of the aggregate window in Unix Milliseconds, respectfully.
These fields are necessary to differentiate 
the incoming data overtime.

Besides `Polygon.io`, 
there are other examples worth mentioning:

# `RESTful` API Design and Best Practices

In this section, we are going to be outlining
the best design and implementation practices
you should follow to get
a *performant, scalable, easy-to-use and maintainable `API`*.

This list has no specific order. 
They are a "bundle" of tips you can follow
to make implementing the API 
and *using it* **much easier**.

## Provide sensible `Resource` names

Creating a URL hierarchy representing resources 
is important so there's clarity and context 
of what a given request does.

For example:

```
/customers/12345/orders
```

Here are a few tips:

- use identifiers in your URLs instead of query params.
*Query params* are **awesome for filtering**, not for resource names.
    - `/customers/12345` ‚úÖ
    - `/api?type=customers&id=23` ‚ùå
- resource names **should be nouns**, instead of verbs.
The `HTTP Verb` should be logical, like `GET requests`  ‚úÖ
(instead of `GET requesting`, for example ‚ùå).
- use *plurals* in URL segments.
    - `/users/123/orders/2/items/1` ‚úÖ
    - `/user_list/123/order/2/item/1` ‚ùå
- use lower-case in URL segments. 
If you need to separate words, use `_` (underscore)
or `-` (hyphen).
Some servers ignore case, so it's best to be clear.

## Use adequate `HTTP` response codes to indicate status

Response status codes are part of the `HTTP` specification.
It only makes sense our `REST` API should return relevant `HTTP` status codes.

For example, when a resource is created (`POST customer`),
the API should return `HTTP` status code **201**.

There are **various** codes to choose from.
Check the following link to see the ones that are available
and the ones that are mostly used.

+ List of possible HTTP Status Codes: https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html

## Use `query parameters` to filter, sort or search resources

The resource URLs **should be as lean as possible**, 
meaning that advanced search requirements
should be shifted to be used with `query params`
on top of the base resource URL.

#### Filtering and sorting

We can use a unique `query param` for each field
that we want to filter to.
Suppose we have `/items`.
We may filter these items according
to a `status` field, like so:

```http
GET /items?status=sold
```

The same principle can be applied to sorting.
To support sorting by multiple fields,
we can take in a comma-separated list
and use `-` (unary operator)
to specify ascending or descending sort.

- `GET /items?sort=-price` 
will list items in descending order of price.
- `GET /items?sort=price,created_at` 
will list items in ascending order of price, 
with more recent tickets being ordered first.

#### Searching

We can do a full text search using `query params`.
We may use a `query param` with a letter like `q`
and pass a value.

`GET /items?q=phone&status=sold&sort=-price,created_at` 
will yield the highest priced item 
that was most recently sold 
with a name containing "phone".

Usually you would use a dedicated full-text search engine
like [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/)
in which you would *feed* the `q=phone` designation.

In cases where you know specific sets of conditions
are frequently fetched/required by the consumer of the API,
you could *package these into a single resource path*,
to make it easier for the user to query data.

```http
GET /items/highest_priced
```

#### Limit fields returned in the `JSON ` response

You can also leverage `query params` 
to **choose** the fields you want to receive.
This is extremely useful because it can minimize network traffic
and speed up the usage of the API.

We can use a `fields` query parameter that takes a comma-separated list
(similarly to the sorting example mentioned prior)
pertaining to each field we want to retrieve.

```http
GET /items?fields=id,price,name&status=sold&sort=-created_at
```

You can also *extend this feature* 
to **load related resources to the one we are fetching**.

For example, consider we have a `Car` 
and each `Car` has many `Wheels`. 
`Car` -> `Wheel` is a 1-to-many relationship.

If we wanted to get a `Car` object
and load each `Wheel` object,
we could use an `embed` term as query parameter,
similarly to sorting a resource.

An `embed` term would be a comma-separated list of fields 
that would be loaded and *embedded* to the `JSON` object.
To refer to sub-fields, we could use `.` (dot-notation).
For example:

```http
GET /cars/1?embed=wheel.position
```

This would yield:

```json
{
  "id" : 1,
  "model" : "Miata",
  "wheel" : {
    "position" : "Front left",
    "position" : "Front right",
    "position" : "Back left",
    "position" : "Back right",
  }
}
```

Implementing this depends on the complexity of your requirements.
This also reduces `chattiness`, 
so the user doesn't have to call the API repeatedly for resource information.

## Show meaningful Errors

An API should provide useful and clear error messages, 
just like any other interface.

Besides returning adequate [`HTTP` status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses),
a `JSON` error body should provide a template
that is consistent in case something errors out.

Here's what kind of information *should* be returned to the consumer.

```json
{
  "code" : 4124,
  "message" : "Something bad happened.",
  "description" : "Error description goes here."
}
```

This template is useful for `GET` requests.

On the other hand,
When we make `PUT`, `PATCH` or `POST` operations,
having a field breakdown is useful for the user
to know what *and where it went wrong*.
We could add detailed errors for each field
that was invalid/was the cause for the request to error.

Like so.

```json
{
  "code" : 123,
  "message" : "Some error message",
  "errors" : [
    {
      "code" : 55,
      "field" : "open",
      "message" : "Status has to be a boolean"
    },
    {
       "code" : 52,
       "field" : "message",
       "message" : "Message cannot be blank"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Favour `JSON` over `XML` support

You *should favour `JSON` support*.
Unless your requirements require `XML`, you should add support for it.
Be aware that adding this opens doors for other implementation details
like [schema validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/xml/xml-schema-xsd-validation-with-xmlschemaset)
or [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace).

This is a costly operation and, unless it's a mandatory requirement,
it's a "nice-to-have".
But having this support is outweighed by the time/cost of implementing it.

## Avoid chattiness in your API

When starting to build your API, we tend to build the `URI` paths
according to the business domain or database architecture of your system.

Eventually, you will want to **aggregate services**
that make use of multiple resources to reduce chattiness.

> **Chattiness** is an important concept to take into account
when building an API.
A *"chatty API"* is one that requires the consumer to make
distinct API calls to get needed information about a resource.
> 
> This is **bad** because it will require multiple network calls,
slowing down an application.
This is because each call contains data overhead 
(i.e. sender information, headers, authentication) 
which will slow down an application as well as network latency per each request.

However, it is much easier to create larger resources later
from individual resources than it is to create fine-grained resources
from larger aggregates.

**Start with small, easily-defined resources**. 
You can create use-case-specific resources
with low levels of chattiness later.

This is the dichotomy 
between **chunkiness** and **chattiness**.
*Chatty services* tend to be ones 
that return simplified information 
and use more fine-grained operations. 
*Chunky services* tend to return complex hierarchies of information 
and use coarse operations.

Let's go over an example:

Imagine a dev wants to get product reviews.
But our API only offers a `GET` method to list products
(`/api/products/1`).

```json
{
   "name": "Mobile phone",
   "cost": 500.0,
   "reviews": [
        "/api/reviews/1",
        "/api/reviews/2",
        "/api/reviews/3"
        ...
    ]
}
```

To get the reviews for a product,
the developer *needs to make `N` amount of API requests*.
**This is a major flaw in our API**.


Instead, let's use a resource-oriented approach.
We can fix it by adding a new path -
`/api/products/{id}/reviews `.
By calling (`GET` operation) this endpoint,
the developer would get all reviews
for the product with a *single API call*.
We can extend this with *query params* 
to filter the result.

```json
{
   "name": "Mobile phone",
    "cost": 500.0,
   "reviews":[
        { "id": "1", "text": "Good one!"},
        { "id": "2", "text": "Bad one!"},
        { "id": "3", "text": "Meh"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

## *Consider* `connectedness`

As we've [stated prior](#what-is-a-RESTful-web-service?),
one of the principles of `REST` is **uniform interface**.
One of his tenets is "Hypermedia as the engine of the application state.".

What does this mean?

This is called `HATEOAS` (acronym), and it means that
when a client interacts with an API, 
it expects it to provide information of "where to go next".

Let's look at an example.
This is the old Twitter.

<img width="1318" alt="old_tweet" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/210090822-05aa1538-4e3c-40bc-a6c4-c75049143718.png">

You will notice that there are many options 
one can take in this page.
We can retweet, follow, favourite...
There *are many possible states we can transition into*.
In case you were wondering, there are **32 possible states** here.

<img width="1415" alt="state_diagram" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/210090994-b5ee9379-e58d-4198-8561-0238961fbcef.png">

These are the possible state transitions for this *single node*.
So, in this case, we are making this request
(this is not real, just an example).

```http
GET user/1/tweets/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: twitter.com
```

The response, following `HATEOAS`, 
would include an array of links(**states**)
which the user can *transition into*.

```json
{
    "id": 12345,
    "num_likes": 50,
    "links": {
        "retweet": "/tweets/12345/retweet",
        "report_user": "/user/1/reports",
        "follow_user": "/user1/12345/followers",
    }
}
```

If you want to have an opinionated introduction to `HATEOAS`,
we recommend you watch this video from Google.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UXc71O7htc&ab_channel=Apigee

However, there are people who think that adding `HATEOAS`
translates into [adding more complexity](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20335967/how-useful-important-is-rest-hateoas-maturity-level-3)
to the `REST` API 
and its main advantage can easily be achieved
through a well-crafted documentation.

Regardless, the user needs to *easily* know
where to transition to next.
If proper documentation or making use of `HATEOAS` achieves it,
you can pick whichever suits your project's requirements.

## Always use `SSL`

[`SSL` certificates create an encrypted connection 
and establish trust](https://www.digicert.com/what-is-an-ssl-certificate).
Several common authentication schemes are not secure over plain `HTTP`.
For example, Basic Authentication send unencrypted credentials.
To make these connections secure, 
when creating links between networked computers, 
we ought to **use `SSL`** so the connection is encrypted.

You might have heard of `TLS`. 
It is simply `SSL`'s successor (which is deprecated).
The acronym `SSL` refers to protocol 
of these related technologies,
so it is used interchangeably. 

## Lint your responses and add `gzip` support

Make sure you [beautify your JSON](https://jsoneditoronline.org/indepth/beautify/beautify-json/)
when returning it to the user. 
When you encode a `JSON` using a given decoder,
most remove all whitespace
and encode it in a single line.

Instead, you could (and should!)
properly format your `JSON` object,
even if extra whitespace is added to make it more readable.

This extra whitespace is negligible when transferring data,
especially when sending data when compressed with [`gzip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).

So, it's *more readable* for the user 
when the `JSON` is properly formatted,
and `gzip` compression is enabled.

## Accept `JSON` in `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` bodies

When creating resources (`POST`)
or updating (`PATCH`/`PUT`),
the API needs to receive input. 
This is usually in the form of a `JSON` object.

To maintain consistency, if your API returns a `JSON` object,
it should also receive input in the same format.

You should accept a [`Content-Type` `HTTP Header`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)
that has to be set to `application/json`.

If any other is sent, 
you should throw a `415 Unsupported Media Type` `HTTP` status code.

## Pagination

There are a handful of ways of implementing pagination
following the `RESTful` standards.
Instead of detailing them, 
we **highly recommend you** reading the following link,
as it explains this topic in a fast and simple manner.

+ What‚Äôs the best RESTful method to return total number of items in an object?: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43968710/20281592

Just know you can do a combination of `HTTP Headers`
like [`Link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link),
and [`X-Total-Count`](https://github.com/zalando/restful-api-guidelines/issues/116)
and *enveloping* (this means wrapping the `JSON` object in a field).

## Rate Limiting

It is *highly advisable* to add rate limiting to an API,
to prevent abuse from malicious users that can flood the API with requests,
causing it to crash.

It can be useful to notify the API consumer of their limits.
You can notify your API users with 
[`HTTP response headers`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16022624/examples-of-http-api-rate-limiting-http-response-headers).

You should include the following headers:

- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - 
the rate limit ceiling for that given endpoint.
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - 
the number of requests left for the 15 minute window.
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - 
the remaining window before the rate limit resets, in UTC epoch seconds.

Consider the following resources
to implement rate-limiting into your API.

## Caching

**If some recurring requests produce the same response, 
we can use a cached version of the response to avoid the excessive load.**

Caching enables us to store copies of frequently accessed data
along the request-response path.
There are many frameworks and technologies 
that makes it easy to integrate caching - 
[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/), 
for example.

However, we can integrate a rudimentary cache system
because `HTTP` provides a simple built-in caching framework.
All we need to do is adding response headers back to the user
and do validation when receiving response headers from the user.

We have two possible approaches:

- [`ETag`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag): 
an `Etag` `HTTP` header contains a hash of the data representation.
This value changes whenever the data changes.
If an inbound `HTTP` request has a
[`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) 
header with a matching `ETag` value,
it means the data is the same,
so the API returns a `303 Not Modified` `HTTP` status code.

- `Last-Modified`: 
works the same way as `ETag` but uses timestamps.
The response header [`Last-Modified`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified)
contains a timestamp
which is validated against [`If-Modified-Since`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since).

This is a useful, albeit simple framework that can be used.
However, some projects might require more complex requirements
that call for robust frameworks.

## Versioning your API?

![API Versioning](https://i.imgur.com/lu5DhRy.jpg)

It's highly unlikely that an API will remain static.
As business requirements evolve, 
new collections of resources ought to be added,
relationships changed
and data structure might be affected.

It is imperative to enable existing client applications
to continue functioning,
while allowing new users to take advantages of new features/resources added.

Versioning enables the API
to indicate the features/resources that it exposes,
and a consumer can make requests that are directed to a specific version.
This allows users to not be impacted when an API makes breaking changes.


There is [on-going debate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning)
on whether APIs should be versioned,
and if so, how should this be done.
There is no "correct way of doing things".
In fact, [many popular APIs usually do one of three approaches](http://www.lexicalscope.com/blog/2012/03/12/how-are-rest-apis-versioned/).

Let's briefly discuss the three most popular approaches.

### URI versioning

Each time the API is modified,
a version number is added to the URI for reach resource.

```http
HTTP GET:
https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breachedaccount/foo
```

This versioning mechanism is very simple
but depends on the server routing the request
to the appropriate endpoint.

It can become *unwieldy* as the API matures
and more versions are added.
From a *purist's perspective*, 
some endpoints aren't affected between versions,
so it doesn't make sense for the URI to change.

Implementing `HATEOAS` is harder, 
as all links need to change according to the version number.

### Header versioning

We could implement a custom header that indicates the version of the resource.
This approach requires the consumer
adding the appropriate header to all requests
(the API could default to a specific version if none was sent, though).


```http
HTTP GET:
https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/breachedaccount/foo
Custom-Header: api-version=1
```

Implementing `HATEOAS` has the same hurdle
as in the previous approach.

### Media type versioning

When an API client sends an `HTTP` request,
it should stipulate the format of the content that it wants,
by passing an [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) header.

Usually, the purpose of this `Accept` header is to specify 
the format of the body (`JSON` or `XML`, for example) -
this is called [`content negotiation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation).

However, it can be used to define custom media types
that include information enabling the consumer to indicate
*which version of a resource* it is expecting.

```http
HTTP GET:
https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/breachedaccount/foo
Accept: application/vnd.haveibeenpwned.v2+json
```

If the `Accept` header does not specify valid media types,
the API should return [`HTTP 406 Not Acceptable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/406).

This is arguably the purest of the versioning mechanism,
allowing for easier `HATEOAS` support.

### Which one should I choose?

When selecting a versioning strategy,
you should consider performance and caching implications of each one.

For example, URI versioning are *cache-friendly*,
since the same URI combination refers to the same data each time.

On the other hand, Header and Media Type versioning 
will require additional logic to examine the values 
of the passed headers (custom or `Accept`).
In a large-scale scenario, having different versions of API
will result *in a significant amount of duplicated data in the cache*.

Regardless of the one you choose,
there are pros or cons to each one 
and consider possible side-effects accordingly.
[Maybe all of these 3 approaches are wrong? üòâ](https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/).

We recommend you giving the following links a read

## API Documentation

Implementing the aforementioned guidelines and best practices
will pave the way to having an API 
that is scalable and maintainable for other developers.

However, it is *crucial* to have **proper documentation**
so it's easier for customers to onboard into the API.

Before delving into the options for documenting your API
and what specifications you should adhere to,
we should clarify the following definitions:
+ **API documentation** - pertains to the reference manual for an API.
It is *meant for humans* to read and understand how to use the API,
and make the onboarding process easier.
There are many tools available 
for generating and maintaining API documentation.
Many of these can automatically generate 
API documentation as web applications, 
with guides for common languages 
and interactive tutorials

+ **API specification** - is meant to provide an understanding 
of *how the API behaves and links to other APIs*.
**It's an holistic explanation of the API**.
While API documentation is a detailed discussion
of how the API functions and how to utilize it,
the API specification is an *understanding of the functionality*
and the *expected result* of each API function.

While these to terms are often used interchangeably,
and you can derive documentation from specification (and vice-versa),
they mean two completely different things.

Depending on the type of the API, 
you should aim to use different specifications.

+ **`gRPC` APIs** use [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec).
+ **Event-driven APIs** use [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/).
+ **`RESTful` APIs** use [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).


### `RESTful` API documentation tools

Let's focus on `RESTful` APIs, 
as they are more widely used 
and you are most likely going to be implementing one.

[`Swagger`](https://swagger.io/)
is the *de facto* tool for creating API documentation.
They created the *Open API Specification* (`OAS`) industry standard.
From these `OAS` files,
[you can generate documentation that is accessible through a web-app](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

However, although being the most widely used,
`Swagger` is not the only option for documenting your API.
[`Stripe`'s](https://stripe.com/docs) API docs
are often considered a great example of a well-designed,
reader-centric and comprehensive documentation - 
*it feels like an application*.
While the front-end is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/)
and is mostly built in-house,
[they've recently open-sourced](https://stripe.com/blog/markdoc)
the platform they use to generate documentation 
and integrate it with their front-end code - 
[Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/overview).

`Markdoc` is one of the many options 
one may use to produce API documentation.
`Stripe`'s documentation is maintained by a very large team of developers,
but we can leverage a few frameworks to create 
easy-to-use docs for our users without having to spend 
[millions of dollars](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-series-h)
to do so.

We recommend you checking the following list of options
to generate your own API documentation. 
Most of these derive documentation
from `OAS` definitions, 
so we advise creating `OAS` files based on your API first.
These frameworks were chosen with specific criteria;
each one allows versioning for different releases,
includes codesandbox for mocking API calls,
includes page analytics
and serves content in different languages.

- [**ApiDocJS**](https://apidocjs.com/):
inline documentation for RESTful web APIs.
- [**ReadTheDocs**](https://readthedocs.org/):
often used by the open-source community 
to rapidly generate docs. 
- [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/):

Docs-like-code with integrated delivery pipeline



## API Testing

API testing and its automation is a crucial part
of the API development lifecycle.
It helps avoid [regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression)
and make sure our API performs 
*the way it's supposed to*, 
meaning it returns *exactly what we want*
and with appropriate response times.

Testing needs to cover
the most important aspects 
of an API - 
those being **performance**,
**availability** and **functionality**.

- **Functionality testing** checks
if the API works and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
- **Reliability testing** checks if
API can be consistently connected to and lead to consistent results.
- **Load testing** checks if
the API can handle a large amount of requests.

Luckily, there are many testing frameworks
that make it easy for developers to create test suites,
execute and integrate them in CI pipelines.

Here's a list of frameworks 
we recommend using.
All of these might have paid plans 
but also have free plans for single developers 
(unless explicitly stated otherwise).

- [**SoapUI**](https://www.soapui.org/tools/soapui/):
*open-source* testing tool
that covers the entire testing spectrum 
(functional, security, load and mocking).
- [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/): 
Postman is a full API platform that is not limited to testing.
Besides managing different collaboratively APIs, 
creating Open API specifications,
documentation
and monitoring.
- [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/):
similar to Postman, it's a API platform
to design and test APIs with built-in automation.
You can learn more on how to use it
in our [`learn-insomnia`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-insomnia) repository.
- [**Locust**](https://locust.io/):
free, open-source load testing tool.
Swarm an API endpoint with Python with millions
of simultaneous users.
[Can be integrated with Github Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/locust-load-test).
- [**Apache JMeter**](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
and [**Apache AB**](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html)
are a load tester and HTTP server benchmarking tool, 
respectfully. 
- [**Siege**](https://github.com/JoeDog/siege)
is an open-source API regression tester 
and benchmark utility.
- [**Gatling**](https://gatling.io/):
*paid* API load tester designed for Devops and CI/CD.
- [**Katalon**](https://katalon.com/):
quality management platform for
validation, functional, security and load testing APIs.

## API Monitoring

API monitoring is extremely important to manage uptime
and possible performance degradation/
general API behaviour.

Having access to these metrics
is critical not only for debugging purposes
but to make calculated decisions 
that will affect the revenue/bottomline of your project.

With performance monitoring,
you will gain insights of how developers are using your API,
which endpoints are most frequently used.
This can provide a better understanding of areas
that need improvement.

There are two predominant methods of API monitoring:
- [**Synthetic monitoring**](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-is-synthetic-monitoring/)
is a performance monitoring practice that 
*emulates the paths users might take* 
when engaging with an application.
- [**Real User Monitorimg (RUM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring) monitors *how a user interacts with the API*,
instead of emulating them.
In layman's terms, it "records" the journey
of the user along the API calls
and makes it easy to *zero in* on
which step is failing.

There are some frameworks that are free and others
that open-source (or both!)
that allow you to use these two methods.
and you can use in to track the health of your API,
whilst attaining useful insights for analytical and debugging purposes.

Here's a comprehensive list of frameworks
that you can integrate with your API to monitor it.
Each one has a free plan that you can use.

- [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/features/#synthetic-monitoring):
Grafana is an open-source, full-stack platform
that allows you to visualize, alert 
and understand metrics of your API.
- [**Fusio Project**](https://www.fusio-project.org/):
open-source API management platform.
- [**Checkly**](https://www.checklyhq.com/):
monitoring and validation of site transactions.
Collects logs and error traces.
- [**Uptime Kuma**](https://uptime.kuma.pet/):
an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool.
- [**Cronitor**](https://cronitor.io/):
platform to monitor uptime and performance,
with locations worldwide.
- [**Blackbox Exporter**](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter):
allows blackbox probing of endpoints
over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP and gRPC.
- [**Swagger**](https://swagger.io/):
Swagger not only allows you to create,
test and document your API,
but also monitor it.
